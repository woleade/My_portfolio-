[Project 1:Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/woleade/My_portfolio-.git)

Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on health parameters such as glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, and other medical attributes. Using machine learning techniques, the model provides early insights that can help in proactive healthcare decisions.

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost






Project 2:Heart Disease Prediction 

Overview

This project is a machine learning-based predictive model for detecting the likelihood of heart disease in patients. Using various clinical and demographic features, the model helps in early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ the Heart Disease Dataset. It contains medical and lifestyle-related parameters such as:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type

Blood Pressure

Cholesterol Levels

Blood Sugar

Electrocardiogram Results

Maximum Heart Rate

Exercise-Induced Angina

ST Depression and Slope

Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy

Thalassemia


Objective

The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques that can accurately classify whether a person is at risk of heart disease.

Libraries used are

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-Learn for machine learning algorithms

Jupyter Notebook for development and analysis


Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated for this classification problem, including:

Logistic Regression
