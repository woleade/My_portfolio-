[Project 2:Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/woleade/My_portfolio-.git)

Overview

This project is a machine learning-based predictive model for detecting the likelihood of heart disease in patients. Using various clinical and demographic features, the model helps in early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ the Heart Disease Dataset. It contains medical and lifestyle-related parameters such as:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type

Blood Pressure

Cholesterol Levels

Blood Sugar

[Project 3: Gold Price Prediction](https://github.com/woleade/My_portfolio-.git)

   Overview 
   
This project focuses on predicting gold prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. The model utilizes various economic indicators, including stock market indices, crude oil prices, and currency exchange rates, to forecast future gold prices.

The dataset includes historical gold prices along with key economic indicators. It is sourced from financial databases such as Yahoo Finance, World Gold Council, or Kaggle.
